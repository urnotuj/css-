            Due to great technical difficulty and little exploration experience of deep space exploration autonomous navigation, the corresponding navigation performance evaluation system is seldom perfected. Therefore, the establishment of an effective method to evaluate navigation systems for deep space exploration has become a hot issue in the aerospace field. In the aspect of navigation performance evaluation, high accuracy and high real-time performance of autonomous navigation filtering algorithm are required. The navigation filtering technology is the key technique to achieve high accuracy autonomous navigation.

           This paper is aimed at developing a navigation performance evaluation system and different evaluation methods for a set of basic evaluation indicators including accuracy, real-time performance, 
           continuity, and availability. In addition, we analyze the function and meaning of each index in the navigation systems. Our evaluation system can verify whether the function and performance of 
           the navigation systems meet the design requirements, and it is composed of network connection module, evaluation calculation module, and curve display module. With all these modules, the evalua
           tion system can receive navigation filter data, evaluate the navigation system performance indicators through the evaluation algorithms and display the generated assessment result through the
            interface visually for comparison and analysis.
